# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the data into.
# And finally, I did some analysis of the data as per questions asked


#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
(
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.



#Analytics:

#Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT
distinct artist_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10



#What artist released the longest song?

SELECT
artist_name,
MAX(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata



#What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(danceability)
FROM SPOTIFYDATA
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
