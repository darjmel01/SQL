# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I answered some questions on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.


#Top 10 songs based on popularity.

SELECT
track_name,
popularity
from spotifydata
ORDER by popularity desc
LIMIT 10;



#What artist has the longest song?

SELECT
artist_name,
MAX(duration_ms),
track_name
from spotifydata;



#Top 5 of most danceable songs

SELECT
track_name,
danceability
from spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 5;



#What artist name has been repeated on the list more times?

SELECT
artist_name,
COUNT(ARTIST_NAME) AS repeated
from spotifydata
GROUP BY ARTIST_NAME
ORDER BY repeated desc
LIMIT 2;




#To select the top artist from the previous query, select the artist with most popularity within their songs

SELECT
artist_name,
AVG(popularity)
FROM spotifydata
WHERE artist_name IN ("Olivia Rodrigo","Doja Cat")
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1;



#What's the AVG danceability for the top popular songs?

SELECT
AVG(danceability)
from spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 92
